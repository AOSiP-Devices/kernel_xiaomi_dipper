## Branching, mechanics, and stuffs
I didn't have any guidelines for branching mechanics in every Kat Kernel repo, and `I love force pushing` even though I'll not regulary force pushing but when I do `mostly my pushes will happen more than twice` so for real don't `just forking this repo without knowing what to do when I do force pushing some fixups coz I like to dropping commits`
